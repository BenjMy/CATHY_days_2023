Dear colleagues, 

On behalf of the organisation board I'm thrilled to announce that in 2023 we will renew with the tradition and organise the CATHY days! 

We would like to invite you to join our community of CATchement Hydrology modelling during an on-site event held in Padua (IT) on May 29th to June 2nd. 

While the final programm will be published later this year, during this new workshop edition we aim at exploring recent progress in Surface and Subsurface Hydrology modelling, Transport modelling for contaminants, Data Assimilation and Catchement Hydrology.

During the first day, the workshop will gather talks from core developers but also from end users. An emphasis will be put on how to reach students and ease teaching CATHY with modern tools such as Jupyter-notebooks.

During the second day, we would love to hear from potential users feedbacks in order to drive the future priorities in the CATHY developement. We count on your participation.

All the details are updated on the workshop webpage. Can't wait to register? fill now the form on the eventbrite [link to come]. 

For more information, feel free to contact me or other people from the organisation. 

Best, 

Benjamin Mary
