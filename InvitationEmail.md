Dear colleagues, 

On behalf of the organisation board I'm thrilled to announce that in 2023 we will renew with the tradition and organise the **CATHY days**! 

We would like to invite you to join our community of CATchement Hydrology modelling during an on-site event held in San Vito di Cadore (IT) on **May 31st and June 1st, 2023**. 

While the final programm will be is scheduled for mid-December, during this new workshop edition we aim at exploring recent progress in Surface and Subsurface Hydrology modelling, Transport modelling for contaminants, Data Assimilation and Catchement Hydrology.

In particular: 
- During the 1st day, the workshop will gather talks from core developers but also from end users. An emphasis will be put on how to reach students and ease teaching CATHY with modern tools such as Jupyter-notebooks.

- During the 2nd day, we would pay attention to hear from potential users feedbacks in order to drive the future priorities in the CATHY developement. We count on your participation!

All the details are updated on the workshop webpage. Can't wait to register? fill now the form on the eventbrite [link to come]. 

For more information, feel free to contact me or other people from the organisation. 

Best, 

Benjamin Mary, Matteo Camporese <matteo.camporese@unipd.it>, Claudio Paniconi <Claudio.Paniconi@inrs.ca> and Mario Putti <mario.putti@unipd.it>
