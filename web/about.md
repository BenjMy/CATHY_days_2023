Not much here right now, sorry about that.

The meeting will be focused around a number of full-length talks (30-45 min) plus several shorter presentations (5-15 min, depending on the total number of contributions) that will address current progress and challenges in: 

* coupled Surface and Subsurface Hydrology modelling
* Transport modelling for contaminants
* Data Assimilation 
* and Catchment Hydrology at large.
